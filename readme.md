# Advent of Code
[About Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# Why am I doing this?
To challenge myself and keep my Python skills fresh. 
Each puzzle challenges my logic and programming skills. 

# Concepts
Each puzzle explores a different programming concept. These are my notes on my experience with each puzzle.
| Day | Concept | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| 01 Historian Hysteria | Sorting and pairing arrays. | Easy first day. Basic sort and matching of arrays. |
| 02 Red-Nosed Reports | Array manipulation. | Again, basic array manipulation with basic logic to find inconsistencies within an array. |
| 03 Mull It Over | Use Regular Expressions to extract pertinent information. | I found this really fun. Regular expressions are almost magic to me. |
| 04 Ceres Search | 2D array manipulation. | It's a word search! Trickier array manipulation and logic techniques are required. |
| 05 Print Queue | Dynamic array manipulation | Using changing 'rules', arrays need to be evaluated, then later amended. This was challenging, but manageable.  |
