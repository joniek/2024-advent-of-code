# [About Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# Why am I doing this?
To challenge myself and keep my Python skills fresh. 
Each puzzle challenges my logic and programming skills. 

# Concepts
Each puzzle explores a different programming concept. These are my notes on my experience with each puzzle.
| Day | Title | Concept | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Historian Hysteria | Sorting and pairing arrays. | Easy first day. Basic sort and matching of arrays. |
| 02 | Red-Nosed Reports | Array manipulation. | Again, basic array manipulation with basic logic to find inconsistencies within an array. |
| 03 | Mull It Over | Use Regular Expressions to extract pertinent information. | I found this really fun. Regular expressions are almost magic to me. |
| 04 | Ceres Search | 2D array manipulation. | It's a word search! Trickier array manipulation and logic techniques are required. |
| 05 | Print Queue | Dynamic array manipulation | Using changing 'rules', arrays need to be evaluated, then later amended. This was challenging, but manageable.  |
| 06 | Guard Gallivant | Traversing a 2D array | Mapping out a route in a 2D array, and getting out of loops. Part 2 was trickier than part 1. |
| 07 | Bridge Repair | Recursive functions | Using a recursive function to discover all possible combinations of an equation. I enjoyed the challenge.  |
| 08 | Resonant Collinearity | Mapping a 2D array | Plotting new points in a map required more thought on breaking the solution down into smaller functions. It was challenging and fun.  | 
| 09 | Disk Fragmenter | Swapping values within a 1D array | The tricky aspect was moving 'files' in blocks. I needed to think through using shallow or deep copy to ensure values were kept intact, while ensuring that groups of 'files' could move together. It was a good mental workout.  |
| 10 | Hoof It | Recursion | Using recursion to traverse a 2D 'hill' and return the trails. Part 2 was a challenge to discover every possible route up this 'hill'. |
| 11  | Plutonian Pebbles | Memoization and recursion | This puzzle properly humbled me. The problem was seemingly simple but computationally expensive. To solve this, I had to look up a [Reddit Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hbnyx1/2024_day_11python_mega_tutorial/) to brush up on my memoization skills. After a code rewrite, the speed improved immensely! |
